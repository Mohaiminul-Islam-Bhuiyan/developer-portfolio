            <p>All cats are pretty adorable in their own right. In fact, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kitty cat that
                didn’t elicit a drawn-out “awww!” But we’ve gone ahead and upped the ante with this list of small cat
                breeds that weigh no more than 10 pounds. Aside from being super cute and super tiny, each one has a
                distinct personality type that makes it perfect for families—maybe your family!</p>

            <h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
            <h5>Food habits and others</h5>
            <p>A cat's energy intake should be increased gradually by up to 50% over her maintenance intake through
                pregnancy. You can use kitten food to provide nutritional support during the last few weeks of
                gestation.
            <p>After birth, the mother cat's energy needs increase by 50% to 75% over normal in the first week to twice
                normal the second week and to three times during the third week. The third and fourth weeks are the most
                demanding because kittens are still consuming milk and have not begun to eat dry or canned food. Once
                kittens begin weaning, the mother cat should be tapered back to normal food portions to avoid
                unnecessary weight gain.</p>
